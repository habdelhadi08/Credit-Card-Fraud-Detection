🎯 Objectives
Mitigate data imbalance in credit card fraud detection using:

- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)

- ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)

- Build and compare traditional and augmented fraud detection models.

- Improve precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to minimize false negatives.

- Address ethical concerns: data privacy, bias mitigation, and fairness.

📊 Dataset
The dataset used for this project is a publicly available anonymized credit card transaction dataset designed for fraud detection analysis.  
Due to data privacy considerations, the dataset is not distributed with this repository.  
Please refer to your learning platform or official resources to access the dataset.
